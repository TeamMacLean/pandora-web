STEPS

autocompletion features
    - on new bag page, get species list, and update redux store, then display species list
    - use an autocomplete field in modal
    - show species list in autocomplete field only
    - cannot enter unknown species (CAN'T try with 0, so try with 1)
        + is UX here clear?
    - manually 'inactive-delete' all species
    - cannot submit if 0 species available 
        (just set as required - required message could be contact your admin)
        + disable at least one upload/key button
        + error/warning text that an admin must add at least 1 species
    - re-enable 2 species
    - successfully select either species (2 runs)
    - form submit updates database
        + probably DONT need to update redux store, but use redux action?

admin area
    - put deeks, mpage as admins on .env
        + ask Martin who other admins are and add them
            ~ ask ruud
    - update .env.example with bad admins
    - if admin, then admin panel on header (deeks: admin, logout), which takes you to admin page
    - admin page/URL only accessible if admin

list species in admin area
    - on admin page, refresh species list (including through redux store) and get them to display 
        + (cf. lke you did earlier)
    - list all species, 
        + get raw list
        + get them component-ised
            ~ copy Datahogbeta/admin ?
            ~ NB add x next to them soon
    - button to add another
        + modal with for that has all inputs (see similar example when adding new box)
        + stop any duplicates being added
    - rename function is a cut/paste job from add new (optional)
    - add X next to them
        + get delete to actually delete them
    - format long list / filter
        + any simple formatting, e.g. 12 entries to a row (use Martin's tip or just endless columns)
        + if this looks too long, put a filter search list in
            ~ find it in buefy, see how it works
            ~ test it how you'd expect to use it, add a note on webpage if necessary
WONT DO: 
    - delete all button for list species, upload species from file/json
    - link species ID to bags in database, when making new bag
        + this means you cannot do a system-wide species rename
    - test if these operations fail (by removing sequence collection?)

*) refactor ALL sequences to species
*) testing script, run through beforehand (NB copy/paste this list to Martin demo then staged demo):
    - SETUP: add ~10 species (until formatting is clear)
    - new submit: autocompletes; cannot submit false species
    - new submit: can submit either species
    - access admin area + show filter
    - admin area: delete all species
    - new submit: cannot submit if 0 species(, cannot submit false species)
    - admin area: add 2 species
    - admin area: cannot add duplicate species
    - db: has an accurate record of just 2 species
    - logout, remove yourself as admin, login again, cannot now access admin area
*) give Martin a demo
*) send screenshots of work to Ruud, await reply, ask for admin in config
*) (optional) one-off data insert script (see komondor-next from martin's work?)
---
*) login to multiapp server
*) deploy changes
    - N.B. for BOTH sites:
    - ensure .env file properly copied
*) go to real site
*) test: 
    - how does the site work with 0 species? if user tries to force an unknown species?
*) go to real admin panel
*) ensure base list of species on system
    - check existing species (especially object type)
    - add 1 species, check against existing
    - delete existing types OR use to check add duplicate feature
    - manually add 89 species OR deploy script
*) test the features work remotely (please add list below)

DONE
species in database
    - create species collection in database; add/remove
        + name, ID, isActive
        + delete sequence only does an update database
        + create new sequence, 
            ยง if sequence name exists, do an update on existing sequence
